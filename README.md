## Introduction

Stock price forecasting is a critical task in financial analysis, enabling investors and traders to make informed decisions. This project explores the application of various machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Prophet, to predict stock prices based on historical data. Additionally, it includes an algorithm to classify market regimes.
